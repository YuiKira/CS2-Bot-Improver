# R3 Corrected: Runtime Reaction Delay, Smoke Tuning and HE Only Disabled

This replaces the original R3 asset under the same release tag. No additional R release is introduced.

## Bot reaction at all difficulties

- Replace BotAI's unconditional visible-enemy notice patch with a native notice pre-hook.
- Pro templates wait an additional 100 ms before a new visible enemy can be noticed; Rank templates wait an additional 40 ms. Bot profiles are read through the packaged BotController API.
- The timer acts before newly noticed targets enter normal aim/attack behavior. It does not add a pause between every shot. Continuous visibility preserves the encounter; losing sight for more than 0.5 seconds starts a new one.
- Restore original profile ReactionTime values so the earlier configuration-only increment does not stack with the runtime wait.
- Low, Medium and High all receive the same template-specific extra wait. Native scheduling may round waits upward. This is an awareness delay, not a promise of an exact end-to-end shot timing or a change to accuracy.

## Smoke visibility

- Disable the damage-triggered global smoke reveal. Hitting a bot no longer makes the attacker visible through smoke to all bots for 0.8 seconds.
- Extend bullet smoke tunnel duration from 1 to 2 seconds; tunnel radius and smoke density threshold are unchanged.
- The existing bomb-defuse reveal cycle is preserved.

## Grenades

- Only bot high-explosive (HE) grenades are blocked, at database, replay and projectile entry points.
- Flashbangs, smoke, molotovs/incendiaries and decoys retain original NadeSystem v1.2.3 behavior in normal mode. Human grenades are unaffected.
- Other native compatibility binaries, skins, maps, aim priorities and AttackDelay remain unchanged.

## Install and verify

1. Fully close CS2 before overwriting the installation with the new release-windows.zip from this R3 release. The filename is unchanged; download it again.
2. Select any difficulty (Low, Medium or High) in the panel, then start CS2. The delay applies to all three.
3. Plugin versions should be Bot AI 1.8.14-reaction.2 and NadeSystem 1.2.3-nohe.1; Smarter-Bot should be 1.10.4-nohurtreveal.1.
4. Run bot_reaction_status after an encounter. It reports hook=active, difficulty=all, profileAPI=ready, held/released counts and observed notice hold in milliseconds. If inactive/pending, or counts remain zero after combat, report that output; a loaded configuration alone is not proof of active timing.
5. bot_nades should report normal. If an older console/config command set it to off, use bot_nades normal. HE stays blocked in every mode.

Verification: 19 timing/state checks, compiled HE/non-HE policy checks, packaged managed API compatibility and full package difference/CRC checks. This environment cannot run a CS2 match; runtime status is provided for in-game verification.
